Steps to Run the Project Locally
1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone the project repository to your local machine. You can do this using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone git remote add origin https://github.com/2200032547-Giridhar/Portfolio-Tracker-Frontend.git
Replace your-username and your-repository-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repository-name
Replace your-repository-name with the name of your actual project folder.

3. Install Dependencies
Before you can run the project, you need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command inside your project folder:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will read the package.json file and install all the necessary packages for the project.

4. Run the Project Locally
After the dependencies are installed, you can run the project in development mode using:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the development server, and your app will be available at:

http://localhost:3000

The application will reload automatically if you make any changes to the source code.

5. Open the Project in a Browser
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the application running.

Additional Information
Running Tests:
If you have any tests configured, you can run them with:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Build for Production:
To create a production-ready version of the application, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will create a build/ folder with an optimized version of the app for deployment.

Troubleshooting
Missing Dependencies:
If you encounter issues with missing dependencies, delete the node_modules/ folder and package-lock.json file and run npm install again:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
Permission Issues:
On Linux/macOS, if you face permission issues while installing dependencies, you can use sudo:

bash
Copy code
sudo npm install
Conclusion
After completing the above steps, your project should be up and running locally. You can now begin developing, testing, and making changes to your application.
